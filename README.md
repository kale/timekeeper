TimeKeeper
==========

A timekeeping application that tracks time to various projects and categories.

Please note that this application is not going to work without a bit of work. It is setup to use a SharePoint 2007 list as a backend source for projects. This could easily be updated to work with newer versions of SharePoint as well, or the project piece could be modified to use another source.

It also includes several reports built with Reporting Services.

Under the hood
--------------

* Built with ASP.NET v3.0 using C#
* Uses AD for authentication
* SQL 2005/2008 will work
